# Workout-Tracker

### Description 

This repository contains an application that is connected to a remote MongoDB database utilizing MongoDB Atlas.  It was created in order to practice the MVC (Model View Controller) design pattern.

The intended functionality of the app includes displaying burgers in the database to the page, the ability to add new burgers to the database, and the ability to update burgers in the database (not added yet).

Currently, the live application is not displaying the data from the database.

To run this application locally, first you must download the this repository and heninitialize the MongoDB database using the seeds.js file.  Then you can install the dependencis and run the application.

Alternatively, you can access the application at this link: [Workout-Tracker](https://nameless-fjord-56907.herokuapp.com/)
